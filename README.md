# mouse menu

The idea was to create a menu which follows the mouse. In theory, it sounded like a cool idea. On implementation, it's such a bad idea. :\

**First Run**

Run `npm install` to get dependencies

**Dev mode only**

This idea is only in development because reasons.

Run `npm run dev` to start the webpack dev server.

Server will run at localhost:9000
